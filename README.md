# ATM System

This is an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system implemented in Java using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It simulates the functionality of an ATM, allowing users to perform various banking operations such as withdrawing cash, depositing cash, checking balance, and transferring funds.

## Features

- User authentication: Users are required to enter their unique PIN (Personal Identification Number) to access the ATM system.
- Cash withdrawal: Users can withdraw a specific amount of cash from their account.
- Cash deposit: Users can deposit cash into their account.
- Balance inquiry: Users can check the available balance in their account.
- Fund transfer: Users can transfer funds from their account to another account.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java source files using a Java compiler.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the ATM system.
4. Enter the required information such as the PIN, transaction type, and amount.
5. Perform the desired banking operations.

## Class Structure

The ATM system is implemented using several classes with specific responsibilities. The main classes include:

- `ATM`: Represents the ATM machine and its operations.
- `Bank`: Simulates a bank and manages customer accounts.
- `Account`: Represents a bank account and stores the account information.
- `WithdrawalTransaction`: Represents a cash withdrawal transaction.
